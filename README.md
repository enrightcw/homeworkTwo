# homeworkTwo

In this homework, I made a three page, responsive portfolio site.  I spent a lot of time trying to mirror the layout in the images, and while I got close, I'm not happy with how the various elements ended up aligning.  I used too much of my time at the beginning of this week working on my enrightcw.github.io page, instead of front-loading the homework.  That's not a mistake I'll make again.

Wrestling with the navbar was definitely a bit of a headache, but once I kind of got that working, everything else started to fall into place.

Notes:
- The main image worked locally as it's saved in the assets folder, and while I did upload the assets folder to github, I must have missed something in the code to make it work live.  I think I just forgot the period before the '/' as in './assets/image'.
